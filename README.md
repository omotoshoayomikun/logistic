# Logistics single page website
## Introduction:
This is a single-page website built using React for a logistics company that provides transportation and delivery services. The website features a modern design and provides information about the company's services, pricing, and contact information.

## Project structure:
The code base is organized into separate components, including Header, Slider, Testimonial, Blog, The_Transporters, WhatWeDo, WhyChoose, WhyUs, Footer, Services, Pricing, and Contact. The main file is App.js, which renders the components. 

## Dependencies:
This project requires Node.js and the React. These can be installed using npm, the Node.js package manager.

## Installation and usage: 
To run the project, first install the dependencies using npm install. Then, start the development server using npm start. The website can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.

## Difficulties encountered: 
One difficulty I encountered during development was that the initial width of the entire design in the Figma link provided was really big compared to the size of my system screen and this make it difficult to get the white space of the design from both the left and right.
Another challenge was styling the components using CSS, as i had to ensure that me styles didn't conflict with the others.
